# To-do-List
A simple and responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Users can also assign priority levels to tasks. All tasks are saved in the browser using localStorage, so they remain even after the page is refreshed.
